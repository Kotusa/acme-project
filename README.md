ACME template
=============
Hello there!
Once I started to learn new cool features, I wanted to practice them.
I tried to make a markup of base Platforma Web Wireframe Kit template. I found out that this design would suit my current needs in practicing my skills.
This ACME project is based on [Gulp4](https://gulpjs.com/) ;)
This is a simple portfolio pet project! ;)
You can see the project's preview on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/112355379/ACME-Pet-Project);
#### The things I used in this project:
- GULP 4;
- PUG;
- SASS/SCSS;
- JQUERY;

#### This is main stack, but this work also includes things like:
- **Mixins** and **other pug features**;
- Popular **libs** for some cases (e.g. progressive images);
- **SVG-sprites**;
- Simple **animations**;
- Cool **favicons**;
- **Eslint**;
